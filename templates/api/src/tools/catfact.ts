      "Cats are believed to have been first domesticated in ancient Egypt around 4,000 years ago, although recent archaeological evidence suggests that the relationship between humans and cats may have begun much earlier, possibly around 9,000 years ago in the Near East. The ancient Egyptians revered cats so much that they worshipped a cat goddess named Bastet, and killing a cat was considered a capital offense. When a family cat died, the household would go into mourning, and the cat would often be mummified and buried with precious items.",
      "The ability of cats to land on their feet when falling is called the 'righting reflex,' and it's a remarkable demonstration of physics and biology working together. This reflex is fully developed by the time a kitten is 7 weeks old. During a fall, cats can twist their bodies to orient themselves using their inner ear balance system and flexible backbone. However, cats need at least 12 inches of fall distance to complete this maneuver, and they can actually be injured more severely from shorter falls where they don't have time to right themselves.",
      "Cats have an extraordinary sense of smell that is 14 times stronger than humans. They possess something called the vomeronasal organ, or Jacobson's organ, located in the roof of their mouth. This allows them to 'taste' scents and is why you might see a cat making a strange face with their mouth slightly open after smelling something interesting â€“ this behavior is called the flehmen response. This incredible olfactory ability helps cats detect pheromones, identify other cats, locate prey, and navigate their environment."
